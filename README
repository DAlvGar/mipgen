1.- INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MIPGen is a program used to calculate Molecular Interaction Potential
(MIP) grids. These grid files represent the favorable interacting regions
of a probe moiety over the space around some molecule.

The molecule could be either a protein/peptide chain, or some small organic compound
(a ligand). The output of the program is a serie of DX format text files
which contain the energy in kcal/mol for each spatial point in the lattice.

These files can be visualized using any molecular visulaization program like
VMD, PyMol or Chimera i.e. See section 3.- GRIDS VISUALIZATION WITH PYMOL

This software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).






2.- DEPENDENCIES AND INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.1 - DEPENDENCIES

The program is written and tested in Python 2.6. Newer versions should be also stable
although no test was performed. Older python versions might present some errors.

It uses standard built-in modules except for the ones listed below that
should be installed independently by the user:

- Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)

Other important dependency is AmberTools 1.4 (http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools).
This software is REQUIRED for the parametrization of the small ligands (partial
charge calculation and atomtype identification using antechamber) and for the
cleaning of the PDB files (protonation of missing H, coorection of multiple positions for
same atom, etc.. using tLeap).

Make sure that both programs: 'tLeap' and 'antechamber' are executable from any
folder in the system (add the folder containing the executables to the PATH environmental
variable).

AmberTools is also released under GPL license.


2.2 - INSTALLATION

After ensuring that all the dependencies are installed, simply unpack the tarball
to the folder of your choice and the software should be ready to run.

    tar xzf mipgen_XXX.tar.gz

It is recomendable to add an environmental variable pointing to the software
to facilitate execution in any folder of the system (in bash):

    export MIPGEN=/installation/path/mipgen_XXX

then executing the program in any folder like:

    python $MIPGEN/MIPGen.py [options]

or to PATH env:

    export PATH=$PATH:/installation/path/mipgen_XXX

and executing then:

    MIPGen.py [options]




3.- USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program is quite simple to run. You need an input file containing the molecule
over which the MIP grids will be calculated for different probes chosen. The
program will automatically identify the atom types and charges on the structure
and it will calculate the interaction energy for every grid point. The output will
be saved in ascii files with the .dx extension.

3.1. INPUT FILES

The expected input files are of ascii PDB format (http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html).
The program is prepared for two cases:

    A) Calculate MIP grids over a protein
    
        In this case, the PDB file does not need previous modifications or
        preparation. If it does not have hydrogens, the program will try to add
        them using tLeap. In the same manner, if there are atoms with
        multiple occupancy, the program will choose the more occupied position.
        Histidines will be treated as HIE (proton in epsilon position) unless the
        user specifically change the name of the HIS to HID (proton in delta) or
        HIP (double protonated, charged histidines).
        
        In the same way, other specifications can be made over the PDB file (like
        specifying protonated ASP or neutral LYS) following Amber Sotware manual.
        
        The correct parametrization of all the atoms depende entirely on the user.
        If something is left unparametrized, the program will show a warning indicating
        what are the missing atoms.

        IMPORTANT: Do not let the program to guess everything
        if there are special considerations to take care of.

    B) Calculate MIP grids over small organic compounds
    
        In this case, the molecule should contain all the hydrogens and
        all the atoms valences should be correctly set before running the program.
        Apart from that, antechamber should take good care of identifying all the
        atom types and setting the partial charges using AM1-BCC method.
